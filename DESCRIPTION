Description: Whenever you find yourself in a polling loop, hitting a resource
    over and over again (like a web service, or a database connection), often
    times there are more elegant ways to handle than simply a sleep (or even
    worse, hammering the resource.) This package allows for a simple interface
    to stateful backoff using linear, exponential, and random backoff.
